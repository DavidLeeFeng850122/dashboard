# Flags

Thanks to the Tabler flags plugin, you can create flags to visually represent countries or languages. Flags are often used in forms, as an element of a delivery address, phone number dialling code and many more.

## Flag

To create a flag, add the `flag` class to a component and choose the country whose flag you want to use. The full list of countries can be found below.

~~~html
<span class="flag flag-country-tg me-1"></span>
<span class="flag flag-country-br me-1"></span>
<span class="flag flag-country-pt"></span>
~~~


## Flag sizes

Using Bootstrap’s typical naming structure, you can create a standard flag, or scale it up or down to different sizes based on what’s needed.

~~~html
<span class="flag flag-xl flag-country-pl me-1"></span>
<span class="flag flag-lg flag-country-pl me-1"></span>
<span class="flag flag-md flag-country-pl"></span>
<span class="flag flag-sm flag-country-pl me-1"></span>
<span class="flag flag-xs flag-country-pl me-1"></span>
~~~


## Types

To use the flag of a particular country, add the `flag-country-(country name)` class. For example, to create a flag of Andorra should use the following class: `.flag-country-ad`.
