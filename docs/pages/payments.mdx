# Payments

The Tabler payments plug-in will let you use a set of payment provider icons to facilitate the payment process and make it more-user friendly.

## Payment

To create a payment provider icon, add the `payment` class to a component and specify the payment provider. The full list of payment providers can be found below.

~~~html
<span class="payment payment-provider-shopify me-3"></span>
<span class="payment payment-provider-visa me-3"></span>
<span class="payment payment-provider-paypal me-3"></span>
~~~


## Payment sizes

Using Bootstrap’s typical naming structure, you can create a standard payment, or scale it up or down to different sizes based on what’s needed.

~~~html
<span class="payment payment-xl payment-provider-shopify me-3"></span>
<span class="payment payment-lg payment-provider-visa me-3"></span>
<span class="payment payment-md payment-provider-paypal me-3"></span>
<span class="payment payment-sm payment-provider-amazon me-3"></span>
~~~


## Types

Select an icon from the list of payment providers. Each icon comes in two color variants - light and dark, so you can choose the one that goes well with your design.
